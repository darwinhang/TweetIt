Back at it again, trying to get this simple TweetIt extension completed. I could also add Facebook and Tumbler options if I can ever get this to work properly.

The goal is still to have this work like the action that happens when a user highlights text that is part of a Medium post.

I'm having trouble creating a tooltip over the highlighted text.

Okay, I think the problem was that I was not using absolute positioning.
