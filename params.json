{"name":"Tweetit","tagline":"Chrome extension that allows you to easily quote webpage snippets","body":"# This is the demo page for TweetIt\r\n\r\n## About\r\nAt first I wanted to create a chrome extension that replicated the features found on Medium.com and many other websites. I also wanted to get some experience with chrome extensions before I tackled chrome apps. Anyway, This page also works as a demo site. I was able to extract the core functionality into a module that wasn't reliant on the chrome API so that it could be used in other places. While it needs a bit of fine tuning, it is at least usable.\r\n\r\n## So give it a try\r\nSelect text on this page and you'll see a rather ugly \"Tweet It\" pop up. Click on it to tweet the highlighted text.\r\n\r\n<script src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/winious/TweetIt/master/ext/TweetIt.js\"> \r\n\r\n</script>","google":"UA-59160574-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
